Just jumped on to add the list of actors and saw that you had uploaded the use case diagrams already! They look on point to what we had discussed today! Awesome job!

Have a great 4th of July, and see you guys next week.

Everything looks good so far. Do we want to make a link between the Admin and the Quote system? 
"there will be an administrative interface to maintain sales associate and quote information"
Also, how about a link between the Admin and a query quotes?
"It also allows to search and view quotes based on status (finalized, sanctioned, ordered), date range, sales associate, and customer."

Enjoy the long weekend

An other thing to look at as well is how specific we want the "use cases" to be. Say for example the edit quote use case. 
Do we want to leave it at edit quotes or break it down to the each individual options?
