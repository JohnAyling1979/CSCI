I sent an email to the TA just to verify if groups usually did one use case diagram for the hole project or
if they did one for each individual interface

Update: heard back from the TA and her suggestion is one diagram for the hole project.
Hello Johnathan,

You can do multiple use cases for different interfaces but in that case you can end up causing a lot of redundancy and
invest a lot of time. You have to be very careful for each use case diagram to be meaningful and true to the purpose. 
So, I would suggest you choose to design one use case diagram for the whole project.

I hope that clears your question.
