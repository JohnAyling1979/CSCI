Just jumped on to add the list of actors and saw that you had uploaded the use case diagrams already! They look on point to what we had discussed today! Awesome job!

Have a great 4th of July, and see you guys next week.

I just tried it and and it let me do it on my laptop.

Everything looks good so far. Do we want to make a link between the Admin and the Quote system? 
"there will be an administrative interface to maintain sales associate and quote information"
Also, how about a link between the Admin and a query quotes?
"It also allows to search and view quotes based on status (finalized, sanctioned, ordered), date range, sales associate, and customer."

Enjoy the long weekend

An other thing to look at as well is how specific we want the "use cases" to be. Say for example the edit quote use case. 
Do we want to leave it at edit quotes or break it down to the each individual options?
JA

Hey guys, I'll be working on the use case tomorrow and Saturday cause I'll finally have some downtime to sit down and knock it out. Have a great weekend guys.

I just uploaded the Admin use case. Let me know if you think I made it to detailed. Also I was wondering do we go to end when we are done with a search or do we have them go back to a main menu and then logout takes them to the end?

I just uploaded the files for sanctioning a quote. Please let me know if it makes sense, or if you would like to see any modifications made. I tried to keep it relatively straight to the point. I will go ahead and do the quote to purchase order tomorrow since that is pretty straight forward.

CJ I just checked out yours and it looks good (you must have used visio hahaha!) I think we could prompt the user to search again or return to the menu if no other searches are needed. Whatever you guys think makes sense.
