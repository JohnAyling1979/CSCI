Just jumped on to add the list of actors and saw that you had uploaded the use case diagrams already! They look on point to what we had discussed today! Awesome job!

Have a great 4th of July, and see you guys next week.

-Mitch

I just tried it and and it let me do it on my laptop.
CJ

Everything looks good so far. Do we want to make a link between the Admin and the Quote system? 
"there will be an administrative interface to maintain sales associate and quote information"
Also, how about a link between the Admin and a query quotes?
"It also allows to search and view quotes based on status (finalized, sanctioned, ordered), date range, sales associate, and customer."

Enjoy the long weekend
CJ

An other thing to look at as well is how specific we want the "use cases" to be. Say for example the edit quote use case. 
Do we want to leave it at edit quotes or break it down to the each individual options?
JA

Hey guys, I'll be working on the use case tomorrow and Saturday cause I'll finally have some downtime to sit down and knock it out. Have a great weekend guys.

-MM

I just uploaded the Admin use case. Let me know if you think I made it to detailed. Also I was wondering do we go to end when we are done with a search or do we have them go back to a main menu and then logout takes them to the end?
CJ

I just uploaded the files for sanctioning a quote. Please let me know if it makes sense, or if you would like to see any modifications made. I tried to keep it relatively straight to the point. I will go ahead and do the quote to purchase order tomorrow since that is pretty straight forward.

CJ I just checked out yours and it looks good (you must have used visio hahaha!) I think we could prompt the user to search again or return to the menu if no other searches are needed. Whatever you guys think makes sense.

-MM

Morning guys,
Just got done looking over both the diagrams.They look good. I did have a couple things
Admin diagram:
Yeah I agree we should have it go back to a main menu at the end of each task and have a logout option there instead of ending the system.
I noticed in a couple location it has a decision go to an other decision. I wonder if a merge my be a better reprensentation of what is happening at that point.

Sanction diagram:
It starts with the associate entering the quote number. How does the associate get the number? Would it be better if the system displayed the current finailized quote for the associate to choose from.
At "System prompts for user confirmation" you have 2 arrow coming out.  We should probably have just one arrow that come out to a decision
Also at the end at "Prompt user enter a new quote number or exit" you have it going to just end. Probably should have a decision that goes back up to the "Sales Associate enters quote number" and to "exit"

-JA

Hey guys,

I updated the sanction quote diagram and use case to make it more streamlined. Thank you for the suggestions John. Let me know if it makes more sense now.

Also, the quote to purchase order use case and diagram has been completed and uploaded. It is pretty straightforward. Let me know what you guys think.

Hope you guys are having a great weekend,

-MM

I have updated the Admin folder and have added the Actor table.
CJ

Awesome! Thanks CJ!

I have updated both the sanction and quote->po use cases and diagrams. In the sanction diagram I only did "edit" since adding lines, removing lines, discounts and notes would be considered "text edits" in my opinion. I broke it down even further with decision tress, but simplified the whole process. Mainly based off of our in class example. Let me know what you think if it makes sense or if there should be any additions.

I will be working on the powerpoint tomorrow night, so let me know if we need to make any last minute changes to any use cases or diagrams.

-MM

I still think we will want to make the flow for the admin a lot more simplified. I uploaded a quick mock up to the main area. It should cover all the requirements.

Also I didn't see the Actor table. I may just be blind
-JA

I just uploaded the Actor Dicornaty again. I thought I upload it but maybe I forgot to hit the commit buttion.
I am working right now on combainging your mock up with my drawring to make it alot more simlified. I will try to have it posted by 6pm tonight.
-CJ

Actor Dictionary looks Good.  Nice touch with the shading.
-JA

I just updated the admin diagram. I based the manage sales associate on the example he had on blackboard.
-CJ

I just started the Powerpoint for our presentation tomorrow, so I must ask; any last minute changes needed to any diagrams or should we go ahead with our current material?

I was also thinking that we can present our own activity diagrams, which makes it easier to answer any possible questions that may arise.

The way the Powerpoint will be laid out is by the ID of each use case, so here is the flow of the of the presentation
1. Title Page
2. Project Use Case Diagram
3. Actor Dictionary
4. Use Case #1 - Create Quote Specifications
5. Use Case #1 - Create Quote Activity diagram
6. Project Use Case Diagram
7. Use Case #2 - Sanction Quote Specifications
8. Use Case #2 - Sanction Quote Activity Diagram
9. Project Use Case Diagram
10. Use Case #3 - Quote to PO Specifications
11. Use Case #3 - Quote to PO Activity Diagram
12. Project Use Case Diagram
13. Use Case #4 - Admin Specifications
14. Use Case #4 - Admin Activity Diagram
15. Thank you / Q&A

I should have the presentation done in a few hours at most. I will upload it to our repository for you guys to review. It will be pretty straightforward and limited on graphics (due to all of the diagrams).

-MM

Hey guys,

The presentation is completed, you can find the files in "Use Case Presentation" folder. There is the raw powerpoint file, as well as a pdf file (for John since he is running Linux.) Please let me know if all of the information is correct by tomorrow morning, so if any changes need to happen, that I will see them in time. I would suggest having any last minute changes being posted by 10 am tomorrow (7/12/17) this will give me enough time to make the changes, as well as my commute to school.

Also, please delete any old files that are not being used at this time. I looked at the timestamps for all of the files that are in the presentation and used the most recent ones. This will make doing our revisions much easier after our presentation is given, and as we add more files to our project moving forward.

Quick tip: if you make a folder on your machine, you can drag and drop the folder into the repository using the upload file feature (works for me in Firefox on Windows 10). This also works to overwrite existing files in folders. For example, if you make changes to one file in a folder, you can just drag and drop the folder into the repository and it will update the files within.

Have a great night,

-MM

Hey guys,

Good job today with the presentation. He was kind of brutal on the feedback and commentary, but at least weren't told to stop and sit down (yikes!)

I went through and updated all of my use cases and diagrams. If you guys could take a look at them and provide feedback, I would appreciate it. One thing that I had taken away from today; less is better. So I literally took all of his suggestions, his suggestions for other groups and applied that to my latest revisions.

I used "The Clerk" as an actor for the Sanction a Quote and Quote to PO Use Cases since we had missed that one on our main use case.

I also uploaded PDF files of the use case specifications for John since he had offered to print out the hard copies.

Other than that, I will keep checking back to see if you guys have responded or uploaded new files to check them out. I did want you to know that I will be out of town this weekend and without internet. However, if you guys do need to get ahold of me, just email me, z1760164@students.niu.edu and I will get back to you.

Thanks again for all of the hard work, I am sure things in class will only become more interesting!

-MM

Just looked over the two diagrams.

I would say "Sanction a Quote" look all good.

On the "Quote to PO" I think the first part looks good, but I think we need a bit more for after the processing system part. If you look at the problem statement the only thing the processing system does is return a processing date and sales commission rate. So our system need to take that info and compute the commission, update the accumulated commission and send off the email.

Both spec sheets look good. Do we want to have the preconditions. 
 Pre-condition
▪ state of the system before use case starts
▪ optional

Technically we can start the cases even if there are no finialized or sanctioed quote availible.  It would just show a blank screen.
-JA

Use case diagram is fixed. Made some changes to the create quote files so go ahead and check those out.
-JA

On the Quote to Purchase Order:
The Use case diagram calls it "create purchase order" and the spec sheet calls it
"Quote to Purchase Order". I don't care which one we change but they do have to match.
-JA

John,

Thanks for pointing that out! I will fix that when I get home from work tonight. I will keep it in line with the use case diagram and name it "create purchase order."

As far as the preconditions are concerned, I agree with you that we could leave them blank, because as you stated, if there are no finalized or sanctioned quotes, the returned list would be blank.

With the "create a purchase order" what I could do is just add one more step where "The system computes and stores to accumlated commission and sends email to customer." Again, after yesterday, it seems like less is more for the steps/activities in the use cases. Even though there was no good example to follow yesterday, he said that this should be minimal (about 5 or 6 steps) to complete this activity. So I just want to make sure that it gets setup right.

What do you think about that additional step? Any change to the wordage?

Thanks,

-MM

yeah we want to be general but we also need to cover what it states in the problem statement. I would set it up like this
after "The Clerk applies final disconts and commits"
"System sends PO to PO system"
have the branch for unavailable
for the available branch
"PO system sends proccessing date and sales commission rate to the sytem"
"The system computes the commission and saves it the the quote and the sales associate's accumulated commission"
"The system send an email to the customer with all purchase details including the processing date"

That covers everything in the third interface without locking doing it a certain way.
-JA

John,

I just saw your message after I had uploaded the files. I actually broke down those two steps into one. It puts that activity at nine steps I believe. I tried to keep the verbage as close as I could to the problem statement. The specifications were also updated as well, however; I didn't change the folder or file names, but everything is now matching.

-MM

I would probably change
"The System retrives information calculates the commision stores to accumlated commissions and emails purchase order details to the customer"
to 
"The System calculates the commision and stores it to sales associate accumlated commissions and the quote. Then emails purchase order details to the customer"

just cause it sound a little rough at the "the commision stores to accumlated commissions" part.
-JA

I have updated the Actor Dictionary to have the clerk and to make the descriptions simpler. Do you think the descriptions are the right length?
I have also updated the Admin diagram. I added the options for what employ information and how they can search as he requested it in class. 
I tried to figure out what would be the best way to work it as it makes the box really big. Let me know if you have any ideas on how I can make it look cleaner?
-CJ

Actor list:
Sales associate: once they are logged in they can only create and work on new quotes
per the use case/problem statement. Also I think we should mention that they access
it through the internet

Others look good.

should make sure capital leters match the uml diagram in all files

Administer System activity diagram:
under the Quote side:
you have system displays a list of search options
admin enters search criteria("Admin choose search criteria")
system displays search option("System prompts for search value")
admin enters in search option("Admin entes search value")
(system displays quotes matching search)
(Admin picks a quote)
(System displays a quote)

under sales associate side:
spelling on delete in system shows choices
under edit and delete
System should prompte for search value before Admin can enter it.
In a couple places it says system prompts for conformation to delete or update but
it then goes straight to system acknowledges updates.
If we have a prompt we need a choice after or we can change it to "Admin submits updatae"
and "Admin submits delete"

On the spec sheet you have a postcondition of an update record. What about when you view a quote?
-JA

I have updated the verbiage on the Actor Dictionary and the admin system.
-CJ
I'm going to be gone most the day so I am going to go ahead and print out the files now. I will check again at 10 tonight for any final changes and print them at that time.
-JA

I was just looking at your printed files folder and the image called "Sanction a Quote Diagram.jpg" is opening up the admin diagram. I was just making sure that the correct one gets printed.
-CJ

Thanks for catching that.  All fixed. 
-JA
 So the printed files folder has the current models that were turned in.

I have added version 1 for the admin classe diagram. I left the entity for the quote table empty as I want to make sure I have the same items in my table as yours.
If everyone has things in by tomorrow at 8:30pm I can combine them and put something together for the presentation for Wednesday.
-CJ

I added the diagrams for the Sanction Quote and Create Purchase Order in the Classes Diagrams folder. The main GUI portions are complete, however; I wasn't sure what John has yet, so I just kind of winged it for the controller and gateway on the sanctioned quote part of the class diagram. This is the first run so let me know what changes you guys see fit.
-MM

I've got the create quote classes added. It contains the quote entity and line entity. Add any aditional attributes you need for yours.  I'll look closer tomorrow.
-JA

I know we are super pressed for time. Are you going to be able to make up a power point for Wednesday and if so when do you need the final copy by.
-

I was wondering the same thing, are you making the PowerPoint CJ?
-MM

At least it should be shorter this time.
You'll have the one main page that has all the classes and then just a page for each class that has any descriptions on it.
-JA

A couple ? on the saction and po classes. You have 2 private function add and edit secret notes. What member fucntion is used to call those? Also in the manage quote controller there is an updatequote do you want the controller to have access to the database or should that call a fuction in quote gateway?
Finally on the PO side I don't see any fuctions communicating with the quotegateway.


Sorry for the delay in response I had a busy day at work and now my internet is out at home so I am typing this on my phone. 
I can combine it and make the PowerPoint if everyone has things done by 8:30 tonight or another option due to timing is we could just use the HTNL output. He never said it had to be in a PowerPoint.
-CJ

That works. Make any needed correction that you feel it needs and put it together.
Yeah it doesn't need to be power point but i think it looks better then using the projector.
-JA

I just looked at the HTML docs and I think that will work fine for tomorrow. From Index it shows the classes diagram and then if needed it can go into each individual class. See what Mitch says, but I think that will be the way to go.
-JA

John,

As far as your questions go, I wasn't sure as to where to go with the quotes since I did those before you had uploaded your files. So I was just taking a guess at it. As far as the add/edit on the secret notes, you're right, those should be public functions. Since the Sanction Quote only resides within the quote system, there really isn't much it communicates with, other than the quote database itself. I tried to lay that out with the diagram, again, before seeing how your quote system interfaces with the quote database. 

As far as the PO's are concerned, I had setup my diagrams to be part of the larger whole (the entire system) as I was basing my diagrams off of the Payroll example the professor provided us. In his example, the class diagram is the entire system or Use Case if you will. So essentially, the PO classes will communicate with the Quote database, where they could technically use the same controller and gateway back into the quote database. The PO system also interfaces with the Processing system to get the processing date and commission rate, which is diagramed out.

I agree with using the HTML docs. It's a much easier way to present the information than tossing it into a PowerPoint. Throw it on a flash drive since the workstation in the classroom allows USB drives.

I'll take a look at what you guys have now that I am home, and fix a couple of the small issues on my diagrams, and report back.
-MM

New class diagrams have been uploaded. They are in the Classes folder. Let me know what you think of the changes. All classes are also documented in the .mdj files.
-MM

I have added the class Diagram. Let me know by tomorrow at noon if there are any changes you want me to make before I export it to HTML and save it to a jump drive.
-CJ

On the sales associate entity they should be attributes since that will be the database information.
Also go ahead and remove the : from in front of some of the classes.  It's not needed there.
On the quote entity you have 2 attributes. Attribute1 and Attribute2. Could we get a more descriptive name for those?
In the QuoteStore we have a addLine() and addLineItem(). I'm guessing those are the same thing.

I went ahead I made the changes and updated the file.

I know it is probably to late to change for today but for the hard copy. The entity LineItem will need a foreign key into
the quote table.
-JA

I went ahead and set up the tables on my database.  Login info is user z981329 password 1979Jul29. The are setup just like the class diagrams. All the capitalization is the same except SAid is saId, lineID is lineId, and QuoteID is quoteId so they match the other naming conventions

I have made the changes below to the class diagram. I will submit it to the TA Sunday night unless I hear otherwise from you.
-Changed the ID names to what is in the database
-Added salesAssociate in the Quote table. I also updated the database.
-I put "sendEmail" in ManagePurchaseOrder. Is that how we decided we wanted to do it?
-I put “setSalesCommission” (Do you think we need this or we could say the creatPurchaseOrder is also doing it?) under the MnageOurchaseOrder and put “updateCommission” under STstore. Then I made a connecting line.
--CJ

All looks good. I know we were talking about how to handle the status of the quote. Right now there were 2 ways:
The current one with a bool for each which will get turned on and off as the quote passes to the next stage.
or
A string with the word "Finalized","Sanctioned", or "PO" in it.
It doesn't really affect the create quote section of the system so it is more how you and Mitch want to do it.

My vote is on the bools. I think they will use up less memory and the code looks nicer. if(isFinialized) vs if(status=="Finialized")

May need to change the caps on the admin GUI. All the other classes are lower case first word and Upper case on the rest while admin is upper upper.

I agree. The bools are much easier to work with.
-MM

I don't think i need a addLine() operation in the CreateQuoteController.  The addLine() in the interface will make the lines in the interface and then everything will get passes with the finalizeQuote().
-JA

I was wondering is STstore so post to be SAstore?
-JA

I see you put a couple names into the SalesAssociate. I went and added mine. I did notice that on the password field that you 
used the regular text. When I made the table I set the size the handle SHA-256 encription so that way the passwords can't be read. for mysql the command is SHA2("pass",256)
-JA

So each of the classes have a short discription. Are there any operations that any of you feel need there own discriptions. I feel tha names are descriptive enough but I'm not sure if the TA would want more discriptions.
-JA

I have changed the caps on the admin GUI and have removed the addLine(). I have also added SHA2 to the admin interface. 
I was also looking at the STstore today thinking it looked weird I have updated it to be SAstore.
-CJ

Need to add a "getCustomerNames()" to te CreateQuoteController and LegacyDatabaseInterface. it gets all the names while getCustomerInfo() get the info for one individual customer.
Thanks
-JA

Also addLine() is not needed in the SalesAssociateInterface or CreateQuoteController class
-JA

And no createQuote() in the QuoteStore because the store database doesn't need to be accessed until the finalized button is used so the quote will get created and finalized at the same time
-JA

also add customerCity to Quote entity
-JA

So the create quote page is functional and there is a quote with 3 line items in the database for you to work with Mitch. Also
get with Conrad about getting your login created. I still need to doc it,add some error checking, and maybe make it look pretty.
I'm also thinking about move more stuff from the page to inside the class. There are a few Null items in the database. If those cause issues let me know and I can set defualt values to them when it is created.
-JA

Here is a link to create your login. http://students.cs.niu.edu/~z1792261/CSCI467/creat.php
I have also made the changes to the class diagram that you mentioned above.
I will probably wait until Monday to submit it so we can make sure we can make any more corrections that are needed.
-CJ

looks nice.  May want to add the "required" attribute to each input field so that they can't leave it blank
-JA

If you could move the sendEmail out of SanctionQuoteGUI and CreatePurchaseOrderGUI and put them into their controllers. I have the code for sending the email done in the controllers. I am working on both controllers right now, which they are basic and I haven't gotten a chance to test them yet (I am currently working.) Speaking of testing, how are we going to go about testing our entire implementation? I was also messing around with PurchaseOrderProcessing code but I am not fimailar with JSON in PHP, so if anyone has any ideas... Sorry about the lack of updates, work has been keeping me super busy. I'll post the controllers when I get home since I am running out of battery on my laptop.
-MM

No problem Mitch. There's still lots of time. On the json thing Ege had the one example
at https://webcourses.niu.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-4740793-dt-content-rid-1621704_1/users/a132436/Bb%20Courses/CSCI%20467/Project/po.html.  It looks like you need to make
a labeled array and then use the json_encode. Once you have the result then you can pull what you need.

As for the final implementation well combin the functions for the shared classes into one file. After that we should
be able to just host all the files in one html folder on hopper.

To make things easier, and quicker, on our class diagram in the controller for ManageQuote change getQuote() to getFinalizedQuote(). In the ManagePurchaseOrder controller change getQuote() to getSanctionedQuote(). Then in the Quote store add both getFinalizedQuote() and getSanctionedQuote() and remove getQuote(). Because we have isFinalized() isSanctioned() as bools in the database, I can list the quotes based on their status in the SanctionQuoteGUI and CreatePurchaseOrderGUI in drop down lists. The functions are smaller doing it this way, as I can add precision to the search, and I can reuse code across both GUIs when displaying the information. I'll post my "work in progress files here shortly. Feel free to check out what I have on the sanction PO page so far: http://students.cs.niu.edu/~z1760164/sanctionQuote.php

-MM

Looking good. I see you've made a couple of quotes yourself. Was everything intuative
enough in the create quote?
There are a couple things with the sanctionQuote. 
I don't see the "sanctionQuoteGUI" class

I see a call to a member fucntion of the QuoteStore class on the main page, but per the
diagam the QuoteStore should be reachable thru the controller

in the class ManageQuote I see a var for a QuoteStore instance. I don't think Ege wants
it done that way. Also need to add a $ in the new statment

The sql statment "SELECT quoteId FROM Quote WHERE isFinalized" will also work if you want

in the sanctionQuote.php you won't need the first while statment because quoteId is a
primary key in the quote table.

To be honest, this project has a much different coding "feel" than what I am used to as far as splitting everything up and using classes/function/drivers and whatnot. I usually write it all straight to the point when doing web programming. So it's taken me longer to do this. Right now I am just trying to get things to work. I will worry about the classes and whatnot later since I feel I have a ton to do with both the sanction and P.O. parts. I plan on reusing code that I know works throughout. So any help or edits are much appreciated. I have to leave in a few minutes for a few hours, but I just uploaded new code with some page formatting changes. I will keep working on it when I get back.

p.s. the create quote page was nice and straightforward.

-MM

I was telling my wife the same thing. I would just have the bounday's all talk directly to each other without the controller middle man. I had ask Ege about it and I guess it's to make changes easier.

Updated files in the "Mitch Source Work In Progress" folder. I went ahead and made a function called displayQuote() in the SanctionQuoteGUI class that I will also be using for the CreatePurchaseOrderGUI class, so we will need to add that to our class diagrams. This will work in conjunction with the getFinalizedQuote() and getSanctionedQuote() functions I have suggested instead of getQuote(). John, thank you for the suggestions, and I added your addLine() function to my sanctionQuote driver but have not implemented yet since I have to write a ton of other functions for edit,delete and the discounts. I am calling it a night. You can check out the new implementation thats up and running here: http://students.cs.niu.edu/~z1760164/sanctionQuote.php

-MM

Looks to be coming together well. In the addLine function I ended up haveing to add <br> element to each of the input elements because on a wider screen size it was able to fit 2 side by side.
-JA

I'm still not sure about having the AllnOne for the PurchaseOrderProcessing in the 
class diagram. We arn't going to have a class called "PurchaseOrderProcessing". 
The PurchaseOrderGateway will comunicate with outside system. It's simialer to the 
LegacyDatabase. So if we keep the AllnOne on the Purchase Order then I think we should
add one for the LegacyDatabase aswell
-JA

I was thinking with your line items on the sanctionquote page. If you displayed them as input text elements with what is in the database
as the initual value that would cover the edit part for you.
-JA

I went ahead and made the changes to the class diagram that you talked about MM. I wasn't sure what kind of free time CJ today. If
everyone can take a look over it and make sure the classes are the way you like them because after this point if the class/function is
is in that diagram it will have to be in the code.
Now from my understanding if it isn't in the class diagram it can still be in the source.
What time were you thinking you were going to mail the docs off?

I will see what I can do about the line items on the sanction quote page. I will be spending most of the day working on the
other functions that need to be implemented in the sanction quote. I am going to try to keep them in a way that
can be used (with minor changes) in the Create PO page. With that being said, if someone would like to try to code the
the interface and controller to the purchasing system, that would help out a lot. After today, my time is going to be
limited due to work, as Wednesday and next Sunday will be the only times that I have a large block of time to sit down
and keep working on this. I am hoping today that I can make some good head-way, as the main part of displaying the quote
is done, with minor changes of course. It took a lot longer since we are coding this in a way that I haven't done in web
programming before. However, I still need to write the updateQuote() class that will be used for both controllers.

As far as the "AllnOne" I just called it that because it seemed like a "catch-all" based off his example that he had provided to
us. Feel free to call it however you see fit.

I will upload files as I move along. Thats if GitHub cooperates, as it seems to be running odd today.

-MM
