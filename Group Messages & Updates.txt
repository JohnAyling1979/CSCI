Hey Guys,

I cleared out and cleaned up the repository. All of the final files are in the completed project folder. I also saved a backup of
this repository before the cleanup; just in case if there were files you had wanted to save or review.

I hope the final went well for you guys. Again, it was a pleasure working with you guys. Good luck with your studies at NIU and 
hope to see you guys around.

Cheers,

Mitch
